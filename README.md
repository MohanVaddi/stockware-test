Tech to use:
ReactJS / VueJS, HTML5, Javascript, CSS

The Assignment consists of two pages.

Page 1:
Give a list of warehouses in the most optimal and modular way possible.

The listing page should have these feature(you may add more)
-> search the warehouses by warehouse name
-> filter warehouse based on
	-> city
	-> cluster
	-> space available limit
Refer to warehouses.json shared with this mail

Page 2:
Click on an item should redirect to the warehouse details page.

The details page should have edit functionality to edit the warehouse information such as cluster, warehouse name, city, space available, and warehouse live status.

You may also provide an additional feature to add custom fields to a warehouse. The implementation and flow is totally up to you.

Points to be noted:
Use of react-router/vue-router for navigation.
Proper use of redux/vuex for data handling
The layout should be designed using CSS, HTML5 following basic conventions.
Show data set in the most efficient way. Use a redux map to optimize the store calls.
